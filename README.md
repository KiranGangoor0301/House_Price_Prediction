# Project: House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. It is based on the famous Boston Housing Dataset, which contains various features related to housing, such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and more. By building a predictive model, this project provides insights into understanding the factors influencing house prices in the Boston real estate market.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town
- LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population

## Model and Prediction
We employed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the provided dataset. The model was trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, and its performance metrics, such as mean squared error, were used to assess its accuracy in predicting house prices.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can usually install them using `pip` or `conda`.

2. **Data**: Ensure you have the Boston Housing Dataset or provide a path to the dataset in the code.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the code to train the model and make predictions. The model's predictions will be based on the input features.

4. **Evaluation**: Review the model's performance metrics to assess its accuracy in predicting house prices.

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
